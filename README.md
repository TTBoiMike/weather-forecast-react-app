# Weather Forecast React App

Weather forecast app built using React.js and the Openweather Api.

### About the project

This is project using React and the Openweather Api to display current weather data and forecast data for a given location in the United Kingdom or Ireland. Users can search for any location using the GB or IE area code to get the current weather conditions and a 5 day forecast for that city. The app shows temperature, wind speed, conditions and chance of precipitation.

The project uses two API calls to retrieve the data. The first call is made using a city name and the second call is made using the geocoordinates of that city to receive weather data from the Openweather OneCall Api.
